# Data Driven Insights for Coupon Acceptance 
** Dataset explored [here:](https://github.com/lvhaohan59/jingprojects/blob/main/data/coupons.csv)
** Jupyter Notebook with Code [here:](https://github.com/lvhaohan59/jingprojects/blob/main/coupon_acceptance_analysis.ipynb) 

## Objective
Customers can receive coupons via mobile phone while driving through town to attract business to local businesses. This analysis is conducted to gain insights on the customer characteristics that tend to accept these couponsfor bars and coffee businesses. The insights can be used to target specific customers to increase chances of coupon acceptance, leading to potentially increased revenue to these two type of businesses.

To explore the data, you will utilize your knowledge of pandas and Python to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon. Utilize the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create a visualization using Python. Ensure that your findings are clearly stated in a separate section alongside actionable items and recommendations.

Your repository should also include a READMe file containing a brief nontechnical report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.
