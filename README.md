## Objective
Customers can receive coupons via mobile phone while driving through town to attract business to local businesses. This analysis is conducted to gain insights on the customer characteristics that tend to accept these couponsfor bars and coffee businesses. The insights can be used to target specific customers to increase chances of coupon acceptance, leading to potentially increased revenue to these two type of businesses.
