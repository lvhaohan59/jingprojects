# Data Driven Insights for Coupon Acceptance 
## Jupyter Notebook with Code: [here](https://github.com/lvhaohan59/jingprojects/blob/main/coupon_acceptance_analysis.ipynb)
Your final submission should include the Practical Application 1 Jupyter Notebook and other relevant files, such as the dataset provided and uploaded to a public-facing GitHub repository as your first portfolio project. To explore the data, you will utilize your knowledge of pandas and Python to create statistical summaries demonstrating differences in those who accepted and rejected the coupon. Utilize the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create a visualization using Python. Ensure that your findings are clearly stated in a separate section alongside actionable items and recommendations.

Your repository should also include a READMe file containing a brief nontechnical report that highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.
